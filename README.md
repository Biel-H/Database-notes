# Database-notes
I'm studying database from AWS (RDS) and this repository is for my personal notes and using some examples of AWS Labs.

#### I start this repository informing that some commands are with my personal endpoint, so if you use your own account change the endpoint to something that identifies your instance or something like that. ####
